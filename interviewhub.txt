problems - 

1. add a guest mode in the login , make guest mode name as = guest , password = 12345678 , gmail = guest@iiita.ac.in , so that , any user can login with the guest mode . if you found any user is not logged in , in any browser , then treat it as logged in with guest . i mean , no need to navigate to login page , automatically login in the browser with guest id

2. add a AI option in header , make the page , here we will use gemini API keys, it will mainly guide users to prepare for interviews of any specific companies ,it will give minimal , very small answer , and give 2-3 top coding questions most asked in that company .  use a chatgpt like interface for it ,
